Project: Traffic Light Controller with Pedestrian Crossing
        • Details:
            • Design a traffic light controller with support for pedestrian signals.
            • Include timer-based state transitions and emergency stop functionality.
        • Key Deliverables:
            • RTL design in Verilog/SystemVerilog.
            • Testbench with edge cases and timing analysis.
            • Waveform screenshots to verify transitions.
